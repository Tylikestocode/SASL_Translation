# South African Sign Language Translation
## Project Overview
South African Sign Language is the 12th official language of South Africa. The University of Johannesburg estimates that around 600 000 thousand people in South Africa actually use sign language as a means of communication. This means that the SASL is a minority language in South Africa. I have attempted to bridge the gap between the people who understand sign language and those who do not in South Africa. This project is specifically targeted to translate the recognized South African Sign Language dictionary the SASL.
